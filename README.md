# CS-465-Full-Stack-Dev
CS 465 Full Stack Development 1 with MEAN

Architecture:
Frontend we used Express HTML, JavaScript and Angular for SPA (Single Page Application). In using Express and Angular we used the layout of having folders for Model, View and Controller. We did this because both work functionally and would then be used in the connection to the backend that connects JavaScript to HTML.
Backend we used noSQL MongoDB because it is faster and easier for users to enter their data into the database.

Functionality:
We use JSON to store data and data text. We use JavaScript to convert the JSON data into legible text that we can read and understand. One way we did this in the project was we created handlebars for certain parts of the HTML code, like for the title, header and footer for the webpages. 

Testing:
For this project we used the GET, PUT and POST, an API method. We started using this method for endpoints to communicate with the HTML hook but then we added it into our security for the application with the authentication authorization before we allowed the use of GET, PUT, or POST requests. This will limit the number of individuals who have access to make such requests.

Reflection:
This class taught me what combining the front-end and back-end development stages look like when you work on them together. I think this is a class that gives you a better understanding of how much work it takes to make a project. I didn't work much with HTML before this class so that was a nice challenge to this class.
