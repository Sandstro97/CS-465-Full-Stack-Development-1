CS 465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Prompt

You now have a working full stack application that serves the customer! Now itâ€™s time to develop an SPA for your client that will produce rich functionality for administering the client database. You will create an add form for trips. In testing, if you add a new trip you should see it in the database, in the trip cards, and on the Express Public website.

Follow the instructions in the SPA section of the CS 465 Full Stack Guide and address the following:

Develop the Angular application structure using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. Specifically, you will need to:
Develop the Trip list component.
Refactor the Trip logic into a Trip card component.
Develop the Trip data service to interact with the API on the Express backend.
Retrieve and display a list of trips. Select one trip and edit it by updating its values and saving. Code the behaviors for:
POST
GET
DELETE
PUT
Add appropriate CRUD methods to the API backend.
Test Angular in the browser and verify the RESTful API endpoints using Postman.
