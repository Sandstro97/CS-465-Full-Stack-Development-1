CS 465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Prompt:

Refer to Intro, Setup & Static HTML Site in the Full Stack Guide. Before you begin, clone your GitHub repository to a directory on your local computer, update the Git Ignore settings, and create a module1 branch to track the work done here.

Your goal is to create a full stack web application based on the client wireframe. Begin by setting up the website folder in the server framework application called Express. This framework will be able to serve static HTML content and support using JavaScript to code the necessary logic and behaviors required to meet the client requirements. Specifically, you must build a website using the Node.js server and the Express framework.

After the Express site is initialized, you will import the static HTML into the public folder and verify that the web server correctly sends the content to your web browser when you navigate to the proper URL. Specifically, you must correctly place static HTML content into the appropriate Express framework folders. Test the software application by using input and output to show that the application is able to display the HTML in Express. Specifically, you must test the software installation to show that it renders the static HTML content in the browser.
